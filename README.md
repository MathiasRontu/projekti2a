## About The App
**Meal Finder** is a dynamic web application that allows users to search and explore recipes by meal name, category, or cuisine. It fetches live data from [TheMealDB API](https://themealdb.com/api.php), presenting users with detailed meal information, including images, instructions, and categories.

## Technologies
This project uses the following technologies:
- **HTML**: To create the structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: To handle user interaction, fetch data from the API, and dynamically update the UI.
- **Netlify**: To host and deploy the live app.

## Setup
Follow these steps to run the application locally:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/meal-finder.git`
2. Open the project directory and launch `index.html` in your preferred browser.

No external dependencies are required for this project as only native JavaScript was used.

## Approach
1. **API Integration**:
   - Used `fetch()` to retrieve meal data from TheMealDB API.
2. **Dynamic Event Handling**:
   - Added event listeners to handle user input and initiate new data fetch requests dynamically.
3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Styled the application using pure CSS to ensure it looks good on all devices.
4. **Deployment**:
   - Hosted the app on Netlify for easy access.

## Status
**Meal Finder** is complete and fully functional. Further improvements (Version 2) will include:
- Adding advanced search filters (e.g., by ingredients).
- Allowing users to save favorite recipes locally.
